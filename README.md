# Castaway
This is a discord bot that will probably never work ever, designed to motivate me to learn Python. Basically, imagine a music-playing bot such as Rythmn or Octave but it plays Podcasts from the Apple Podcasts index.

Note that currently the bot doesn't work at all, and it probably never will, and if it ever does you'll need to self-host it unless I find this weird neiche of people who like to play their podcasts in Discord and are willing to pay enough so that I can get the server space for everyone to run it free.

## Planned Functionality that might happen
* Play a podcast directly from a feed URL
* Find podcasts through the Apple Podcasts directory
* Podcast search through the Apple Podcasts directory

## Planned Functionality that might happen but probably not
* The ability to subscribe to Podcast feeds
* Notification when a Podcast feed gets updated

As this project is to help me learn Python, I am not accepting pull requests at this time.
